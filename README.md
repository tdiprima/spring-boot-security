# spring-boot-security

## Overview
This project integrates **Spring Security** into a **Spring Boot** application, following the guidance from an excellent but slightly outdated tutorial by [Java Brains](https://www.youtube.com/@Java.Brains). Some modifications may have been made to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Spring Boot and Spring Security.
